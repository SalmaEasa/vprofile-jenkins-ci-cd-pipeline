# 🚀 vProfile Multitier Java Stack: Automated CI Pipeline
##
This repository contains the complete **Jenkins CI Pipeline** for the vProfile Java application. The project demonstrates a production-grade DevOps workflow, ensuring every code push is automatically built, analyzed, and stored.

---

## 🏗 System Architecture
The infrastructure is hosted on **AWS EC2**, utilizing a distributed 3-server architecture to ensure resource isolation and optimal performance.

* **Jenkins Server**: Orchestrates the CI pipeline and executes Maven builds.
* **SonarQube Server**: Performs static code analysis and quality gate checks.
* **Nexus Repository Manager**: Manages internal releases and caches external dependencies.

## 🚀 Pipeline Workflow

- Developer Push: Triggered by a GitHub Webhook  
- Build Stage: Compiled using Maven and JDK 17  
- Code Analysis: Analyzed by SonarScanner for security and bugs  
- Quality Gate: Automated check to ensure code meets standards  
- Artifact Upload: `.war` files versioned and pushed to Nexus  
- Real-time Alerts: Status updates sent to Slack

## 🛠 Project Roadmap (Steps Taken)

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup

- AWS Environment: Configured Security Groups for ports 8080 (Jenkins), 8081 (Nexus), and 9000 (SonarQube).

- EC2 Provisioning: Launched instances with UserData scripts for automated tool installation.

- Nexus Repositories: Implemented a 4-repo strategy: Proxy, Release, Snapshot, and Group.

### Phase 2: Pipeline Development
- Git Migration: Migrated source code to a dedicated repository for CI testing.

- Maven Integration: Configured settings.xml with credentials for secure Nexus communication.

- SonarQube Integration: Configured a "Quality Gate" stage to ensure code meets security standards.

### Phase 3: Automation & Monitoring
- Webhooks: Enabled GitHub-to-Jenkins triggers for continuous integration.

- Slack Integration: Developed a Groovy-based notification block using a COLOR_MAP.

## 🔧 Infrastructure & Engineering Challenges

| 🚩 Challenge | 📉 Impact | 🛠️ Resolution |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Nexus Storage Failure** | **500 Internal Server Error** during artifact upload due to 82%+ disk utilization. | Modified AWS EBS volume (8GB → 20GB). Performed a live resize of the **XFS filesystem** using `growpart` and `xfs_growfs` to prevent data loss. |
| **Dependency Latency** | Slow build times (5+ mins) caused by repetitive downloads from Maven Central. | Configured a **Proxy Repository** in Nexus to cache dependencies locally, reducing subsequent build times by **~40%**. |
| **Pipeline Syntax Errors** | Jenkins build failures caused by complex nesting in the `environment` block. | Refactored the **Declarative Jenkinsfile** to resolve Groovy nesting issues and standardized Global Tool paths for JDK 17. |

## 📦 How to Use
**Infrastructure**: Provision 3 EC2 instances (Ubuntu/Amazon Linux).

**Setup**: Install JDK 17, Maven, and necessary Jenkins plugins.

**Configuration**: Update environment variables in the Jenkinsfile with your specific server IPs.

**Execution**: Push code to the main branch and monitor the Jenkins dashboard.
